# How to Push to GitHub

Follow these steps to push your code to GitHub:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name your repository (e.g., "youtube-automation")
   - Make sure to NOT initialize with a README
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Add the remote repository and push:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to your local repository
   cd C:\Users\ASUS\Downloads\john\Oto-YT-Git
   
   # Add the remote repository (replace USERNAME with your GitHub username)
   git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/youtube-automation.git
   
   # Push to GitHub
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. You may be prompted for your GitHub username and password (or personal access token)

That's it! Your optimized YouTube automation system is now on GitHub and ready for deployment.
