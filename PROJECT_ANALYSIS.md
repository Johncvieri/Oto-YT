# PROJECT ANALYSIS

## Initial Analysis
- Date: Senin, 20 Oktober 2025
- Starting analysis of the Oto-YT project

## Project Overview
- Project: YouTube Shorts automation system with enhanced monitoring capabilities
- Technology stack: Node.js, n8n, Supabase, Google Gemini API
- Purpose: Automate YouTube content publishing with workflow monitoring
- Deployment: Railway (https://oto-yt-production.up.railway.app/)

## Key Files and Components
1. `index.js` - Main entry point with early proxy setup
2. `early-proxy-setup.js` - Critical proxy configuration for Railway
3. `railway-direct-start.js` - Optimized n8n startup for Railway deployment
4. `executor.js` - Auto-monitoring loop (recently created)
5. `package.json` - Dependencies including n8n, Supabase, Google Generative AI
6. `.env.template` - Configuration including YouTube APIs, Gemini, Supabase, Basic Auth

## Environment Configuration
- N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=johncvieri
- N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=@John221198
- N8N_TRUST_PROXY=true (critical for Railway)
- Multiple YouTube API configurations for rotation
- Supabase integration for database
- Google Gemini for AI content analysis

## Deployment Strategy
- Railway deployment at https://oto-yt-production.up.railway.app/
- Auto-deploys on git push
- Expected behavior: Show auth page instead of setup page
- Requires proper environment variables to function
- Workflow monitoring capabilities built-in

## Action Plan
1. Set up environment variables for Railway deployment
2. Ensure basic auth is properly configured
3. Test live deployment at https://oto-yt-production.up.railway.app/
4. Verify workflow functionality
5. Monitor for stability
