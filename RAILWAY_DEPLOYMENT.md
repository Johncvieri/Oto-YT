# Railway Deployment Guide for YouTube Automation System

This guide explains how to deploy your YouTube automation system to Railway.

## Prerequisites

1. **Railway Account**: Create an account at [https://railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **GitHub Account**: Your project should be hosted on GitHub
3. **Railway CLI (Optional)**: Install with `npm install -g @railway/cli`

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Connect Your GitHub Repository

1. Log in to Railway dashboard
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub"
4. Choose your repository with the YouTube automation system

### 2. Set Environment Variables

After connecting your repository, go to the "Variables" section and add all required environment variables:

#### Required Variables:
```
# YouTube API Keys and Channels (3 accounts for rotation)
YOUTUBE_API_1=your_youtube_api_key_1
YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_1=your_youtube_channel_url_1
YOUTUBE_API_2=your_youtube_api_key_2
YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_2=your_youtube_channel_url_2
YOUTUBE_API_3=your_youtube_api_key_3
YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_3=your_youtube_channel_url_3

# Google Gemini API for comment analysis and content generation
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Supabase for database and storage
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key

# Telegram for notifications
TELEGRAM_API_KEY=your_telegram_bot_api_key
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_telegram_chat_id
```

#### Optional Variables (for Production):
```
# For production environment
NODE_ENV=production

# For n8n workflow
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=admin
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=your_secure_password

# Timezone for cron jobs
TZ=Asia/Jakarta
```

### 3. Configure the Deployment

The project includes a `railway.json` configuration file that sets up:
- CPU allocation: 1-2 cores
- Memory allocation: 1-2 GB RAM
- Auto-deploy on git changes
- Process restart policies

### 4. Deploy Your Application

1. Railway will automatically detect the `Dockerfile` in your repository
2. Click "Deploy Now" in the dashboard
3. Wait for the build to complete (this may take several minutes)

### 5. Post-Deployment Setup

After your application is deployed:

1. Access the n8n interface via your Railway deployment URL
2. Set up n8n credentials as described in the README
3. Import the appropriate workflow:
   - For media content: Upload `youtube_automation_source.json`
   - For game content: Upload `youtube_automation_game.json`
   - For trend content: Upload `youtube_automation_trend.json`

### 6. Importing Workflows

If you have workflow files locally:

1. SSH into your Railway deployment using the Railway CLI:
   ```
   railway ssh
   ```

2. Or upload your workflow files via the n8n UI at your Railway URL + `/workflow`

## Important Notes

- **Build Time**: The first deployment may take 5-10 minutes as it builds the Docker image with ffmpeg and other dependencies
- **Resource Usage**: The app is configured to use 1-2GB RAM due to the video processing requirements, but optimized to run only once daily per account to minimize resource consumption
- **Storage**: Railway ephemeral storage is limited, so consider using Supabase for persistent data
- **Process Limits**: Railway free tier has request timeout limits; the daily schedule helps manage these limitations effectively

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"n8n command not found"**: The Dockerfile should install n8n properly, but if experiencing issues, check the build logs.

2. **Environment variables not loaded**: Make sure all required variables are set in the Railway dashboard under "Variables".

3. **Application crashes**: Check Railway logs in the dashboard for error messages.

### Viewing Logs:

1. In the Railway dashboard, go to your project
2. Click on the "Logs" tab to see real-time application logs
3. Look for any error messages that might indicate configuration issues

## Scaling Your Deployment

1. In the Railway dashboard, go to "Settings" â†’ "Resources"
2. Adjust CPU and Memory allocation based on your workload
3. For heavy video processing, consider upgrading to a higher tier

## Health Checks

The application includes a health check script:
- Run `npm run health` to test the system status
- This can be used as a health check endpoint if needed

## Security Considerations

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use Railway's environment variable system for all sensitive data
- The configuration enables basic auth for n8n by default
- Change the default username/password in production
