# YouTube Automation Dashboard Setup

Welcome to your YouTube Automation dashboard! Your n8n instance is running successfully.

## Initial Setup

1. Create your first account (you'll be prompted to do this on first visit)
2. After logging in, you'll see an empty workflow dashboard
3. To add the automation workflows, follow these steps:

## Adding Workflows

### Method 1: Manual Import (Recommended)
1. In the n8n dashboard, click the **"+"** button to create a new workflow
2. Click **"Import"** from the left sidebar 
3. Select one of these files:
   - `youtube_automation_source.json` (for source-based content)
   - `youtube_automation_game.json` (for gaming content)  
   - `youtube_automation_trend.json` (for trend analysis)

### Method 2: Upload Files Directly
The workflow files are available in your instance at:
- `/app/youtube_automation_source.json`
- `/app/youtube_automation_game.json`
- `/app/youtube_automation_trend.json`

## About the Error Messages
You may see "X-Forwarded-For" validation errors in the logs. This is normal when running n8n behind a proxy/load balancer like Railway. These errors do not affect the functionality of your workflows.

## Next Steps
1. Import your desired workflow(s)
2. Set up your credentials in n8n (YouTube API, Supabase, etc.) 
3. Activate the workflow to start automation
4. Monitor execution in the Executions tab

Your YouTube automation is ready to go!
